-- Introduction:

A port and redux of Andy Clark's brilliant Universal Internet Explorer 6 CSS.

Having waited patiently for such a long time on non-existent Subversion
access to Andy Clark's Universal Internet Explorer 6 CSS, I decided to just
make my own port of his work and maintain it on GitHub for everyone to enjoy.

There will eventually be three (3) branches for this project:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Original: 
This will contain the same code you can download from the Google Code project 
page for Universal Internet Explorer 6 CSS. I will work to keep this branch 
as up-to-date with the original as possible.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Experimental: 
This will contain my revised version of the original stylesheet which uses 
some different typographical choices and also adds declarations for new HTML5 
elements like article, section, aside, and header. Master will be used for 
trying out any new experimental features before merging them into the stable 
release branch.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Master: 
The default branch will be used for a stable, up-to-date version of merged 
experiments from experimental and any new updates from Andy Clark's version.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Notes:
   
At the time of this writing there is no Subversion access for this project, 
which means you can essentially think of the *original* branch as a Git-based 
port for Andy's work on Google Code. So if you prefer to use Andy's original, 
unmodified version of the code then you want to track the *original* branch 
instead of tracking what I'm doing in the *master* branch.
